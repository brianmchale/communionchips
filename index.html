        <h2 class="manifesto-title">THEY FEED YOU LIES, WE FEED YOU FLESH:<br>EXPLOITING RELIGION FOR PROFIT SINCE 1776</h2>
        <p class="manifesto-text">Every day, hard-working Americans wake up, stare into the cracked mirror of this once-great nation, and ask themselves: How did we let this country turn into such a godless wasteland? Where did we go wrong? Does the devil truly walk among us? That’s what ordinary people are wondering. And the answer is yes. The devil is here. He’s in your schools. He’s in your grocery stores. He’s in your Wi-Fi router. Do you want to be doomed to live in a nation of spineless, faithless sheep bowing to the false idols of government-approved soy products? What can possibly be done to bring back the great word of our lord Jesus Christ as the gospel of American patriots around the world?  <br><br> The only hope left is His flesh itself. Introducing Communion Chips, naturally flavored communion wafers now available in a holy trinity of delicious flavors! If we are to save this once great land we must devote ourselves to consuming our savior not just on Sundays but at all times of the day in as many tasty varieties as possible. Jesus didn’t just die for your sins — He rose again so that you could eat His flesh as a consumer packaged good. This isn’t just a snack, this is the gospel of our Lord, available in bulk packs to fill your pantry and save your soul.
<br><br> Join the revolution — this is consumer activism in its purest, most American form. Take back our country from the faithless cretins hell bent on destroying society by buying a bulk pack below! Every wafer is a blow to the godless swamp creatures that want to see America burn. Every bite is a battle cry against the faithless hordes tearing apart the fabric of our society. This is how we fight back — with bold, unapologetic capitalism for Christ. Together we can save our broken nation. Buy now!</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <div class="faq-content">
            <div class="faq-column">
                <h4>Is this a real product?</h4>
                <p>Yes, Communion Chips™ are 100% authentic communion wafers that we season, bake, and package in-house. Our products are vegan but not gluten free. If you have dietary restrictions or questions about specific ingredients used, <a href="mailto:onebraintogether@gmail.com"><font color="white">please contact us.</font></a></p>
                <h4>I'm a Christian and I'm offended by the use of Jesus's name and body for a snack product. How can you live with yourself?</h4>
                <p>What are you, some sort of anti-American commie? If you hate God, capitalism, and the free market so much, why don't you try moving to [INSERT COUNTRY RAVAGED BY U.S. INTERVENTION] and get back to us, 'kay bud?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-column">
                <h4>I tried passing these out during Sunday mass and they banned me from my local church. What the fuck man?</h4>
                <p>Sounds like your pastor has ties to the deep state. If you need us to investigate the matter or have any questions, reach out to us on <a href="https://instagram.com/onebraintogether"><font color="white">Instagram</font></a> and <a href="https://tiktok.com/@onebraintogether"><font color="white">TikTok</font></a> and we'll make sure they never know another day of peace.</p>
                <h4>Am I going to hell for buying this?</h4>
                <p>Quite the opposite - the more bags of Communion Chips you purchase, the less likely it is that you will go to hell. So stock up if you want to fast track spiritual enlightenment. God will remember and reward all preppers and bulk buyers on judgement day.</p>
