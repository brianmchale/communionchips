        <h2 class="manifesto-title">THE TRUTH THEY DON’T WANT YOU TO KNOW:<br>EXPLOITING RELIGION FOR PROFIT SINCE 1776</h2>
        <p class="manifesto-text">Don't let them fool you - every day is a battle when you're defending your faith, your freedom, and your God-given right to live in a country where the name of Jesus Christ can be proudly displayed on every table, every bag of chips, and every corner of this great land. They want to control every aspect of your life — do you think Jesus would’ve let them push Him around? If He were here today, He’d be strapped up and passing out air fried communion wafers in our three delicious flavors - Bibilical BBQ; Salt, Vinegar, & the Holy Spirit; and Hot as Hell - to every red-blooded patriot who’s still willing to stand up and fight for everything we hold dear as Americans!<br><br>THEY FEED YOU LIES, WE FEED YOU FLESH<br>They want to rip away your Second Amendment rights, your Bible, your food, your family, your very soul, and turn this country into a godless wasteland where only they call the shots. That’s why we created Communion Chips — because when they come for your guns, at least you’ll be spiritually armored with the tastiest air fried communion wafers ever blessed by our Lord and Savior. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Every time you purchase a bag of Communion Chips, you’re protecting what's yours and joining the growing army of faithful, freedom-loving patriots who are sending a message to those who want to silence Christians and turn this country into a totalitarian dystopia where you can't snack on the body of Christ.<br><br>Stand with Communion Chips. Stand with Jesus. And most importantly, stand with your fellow Americans in this time of need by BUYING IN BULK.</p>

        <div class="faq-content">
            <div class="faq-column">
                <h4>Is this a real product?</h4>
                <p>Yes, Communion Chips™ are 100% authentic communion wafers that we season, air fry, and package in-house. Our products are vegan but NOT gluten free. If you have questions about specific ingredients used, <a href="mailto:onebraintogether@gmail.com"><font color="white">please contact us.</font></a></p>
                <h4>I'm a Christian and I'm offended by the use of Jesus's name and body for a snack product. How can you live with yourself?</h4>
                <p>What are you, some sort of anti-American commie? If you hate God, capitalism, and the free market so much, why don't you try moving to [INSERT COUNTRY RAVAGED BY US INTERVENTION] and get back to me, 'kay bud?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-column">
                <h4>Am I going to hell for buying this?</h4>
                <p>No, if you buy this you'll actually go directly to heaven when you die because a portion of proceeds from every purchase will go towards funding our mutual aid project, <a href="https://thereforeyou.org"><font color="white">Therefore You</font></a>.</p>
                <h4>There's only space for one more question on here. What else do I need to know if I'm like a CPG VC or something looking at this website for any particular reason?</h4>
                <p>Communion Chips™ are a part of the Gastrobatics® family of brands, which itself is a division of One Brain Together©, a [redacted]-based product studio. Basically like one of those Russian babushka dolls.</p>
